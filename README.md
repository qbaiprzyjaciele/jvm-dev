# jvm-dev

This project is an attempt to create a very primitive version of Java Virtual Machine from scratch mainly for educational purposes. 
It's easier for me to learn deep JVM internals details by implementing jvm concepts described in oracle's spec rather than learning them by heart.
A lot of these concepts are very similar or identical to those used in other runtimes like V8 or Mono so learning them could be very useful for braoder applications.
